{"name":"Pirateget","tagline":"","body":"PB archive scripts\r\n=\r\nThis is an up-to-date fork of Karel Bílek's scripts at http://runn1ng.github.io/\r\nPirate Bay archival\r\n=\r\nSome time ago, I did an experiment on how small I can make ThePirateBay while keeping the important information. People apparently liked it.\r\n\r\nWell, now some months later, I wanted to do two things - first, make it even smaller and correct all the mistakes I did before. Second - I wanted to create another version that will have all the additional information - most importantly, all the comments and text information. For me, pirate bay is not just the torrents, but mainly the additional information - \"How fake is the file; what can I expect to find inside?\"\r\n\r\nSo I did both.\r\n\r\n<p>The \"smaller\" file is for download <a href=\"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8156416\">here</a> - it has 76 MB 7zipped and it really has just names and magnet links.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The \"bigger\" file is for download <a href=\"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8163015\">here</a> - in 631 MB 7zipped, it has all the information about number of seeders, leechers (at the time of the download), magnet links, descriptions, size, and perhaps most importantly - <b>comments</b>. It does <i>not</i> contain the \"big\" torrent files. But apart from that, you can really reconstruct the whole Pirate Bay from it. (I will touch this later though.)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: since the downloading itself took quite long, the data in the older torrents can be slightly out of date.\r\nHow I did it\r\n=\r\nWith this script! Unlike previously, this time I decided to output XML so people parsing it won't get so crazy.\r\n\r\nSome people noticed that the XML files are not well-formed and valid. I am sorry for that, but Karel made perl scripts that will fix them both, see https://github.com/fr0stycl34r/pirateget/blob/master/correct.pl. The script needs Perl, Bash and Sed, so you will need GNU/Linux (OS X may be sufficient but I have nowhere to try).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Pirate Bay admins always started blocking my computers (I guess they thought I am a evil attacker or something), so I had to switch from computer to computer. And because I wanted to make sure I really didn't miss any torrent, the whole thing took about half a year.\r\n\r\nAlso, ThePirateBay had some downtimes during the download. I tried to \"catch\" them, but I still lost about 100-300 torrents. I am too lazy to sort them out now. Sorry.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you can run this script with:\r\n\r\n    perl  piratebay.pl\r\n\r\nTo correct the archive, run the script in Bash on any GNU/Linux distro like follows:\r\n\r\n    perl correct.pl poor outf_poor.xml poor.corrected.xml\r\n\r\n    perl correct.pl rich outf_rich.xml rich.corrected.xml\r\n\r\nIt will make another file with corrected ampersands and added DOCTYPE and DTD definitons.\r\n\r\nThe scripts will probably work on OS X too, and maybe even Cygwin.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese scripts were made by Karel Bílek.
