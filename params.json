People apparently liked it.\r\n\r\nWell, now some months later, I wanted to do two things - first, make it even smaller and correct all the mistakes I did before. Second - I wanted to create another version that will have all the additional information - most importantly, all the comments and text information. For me, pirate bay is not just the torrents, but mainly the additional information - \"How fake is the file; what can I expect to find inside?\"\r\n\r\nSo I did both.\r\n\r\nThe \"smaller\" file is for download here - it has 76 MB 7zipped and it really has just names and magnet links.\r\n\r\nThe \"bigger\" file is for download here - in 631 MB 7zipped, it has all the information about number of seeders, leechers (at the time of the download), magnet links, descriptions, size, and perhaps most importantly - comments. It does not contain the \"big\" torrent files. But apart from that, you can really reconstruct the whole Pirate Bay from it. (I will touch this later though.)\r\n\r\nNote: since the downloading itself took quite long, the data in the older torrents can be slightly out of date.\r\nHow I did it\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
