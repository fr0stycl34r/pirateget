{"name":"Pirateget","tagline":"","body":"PB archive scripts \r\n=====================\r\nThis is an up-to-date fork of Karel Bílek's scripts at http://runn1ng.github.io/\r\n\r\nPirate Bay archival\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nSome time ago, I did an experiment on how small I can make ThePirateBay while keeping the important information. People apparently liked it.\r\n\r\nWell, now some months later, I wanted to do two things - first, make it even smaller and correct all the mistakes I did before. Second - I wanted to create another version that will have all the additional information - most importantly, all the comments and text information. For me, pirate bay is not just the torrents, but mainly the additional information - \"How fake is the file; what can I expect to find inside?\"\r\n\r\nSo I did both.\r\n\r\n<p>The \"smaller\" file is for download <a href=\"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8156416\">here</a> - it has 76 MB 7zipped and it really has just names and magnet links.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The \"bigger\" file is for download <a href=\"http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8163015\">here</a> - in 631 MB 7zipped, it has all the information about number of seeders, leechers (at the time of the download), magnet links, descriptions, size, and perhaps most importantly - <b>comments</b>. It does <i>not</i> contain the \"big\" torrent files. But apart from that, you can really reconstruct the whole Pirate Bay from it. (I will touch this later though.)</p>\r\n\r\n\r\nNote: since the downloading itself took quite long, the data in the older torrents can be slightly out of date.\r\n\r\nHow I did it\r\n=====================\r\n\r\nWith this script! Unlike previously, this time I decided to output XML so people parsing it won't get so crazy.\r\n\r\nSome people noticed that the XML files are not well-formed and valid. I am sorry for that, but \r\nKarel made perl scripts that will fix them both, see https://github.com/fr0stycl34r/pirateget/blob/master/correct.pl. The script needs Perl, Bash and Sed, so you will need GNU/Linux (OS X may be sufficient but I have nowhere to try).\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, Pirate Bay admins always started blocking my computers (I guess they thought I am a evil attacker or something), so I had to switch from computer to computer. And because I wanted to make sure I really didn't miss any torrent, the whole thing took about half a year.\r\n\r\nAlso, ThePirateBay had some downtimes during the download. I tried to \"catch\" them, but I still lost about 100-300 torrents. I am too lazy to sort them out now. Sorry.\r\n\r\nAnyway, you can run this script with:\r\n       \r\n       perl  piratebay.pl\r\nTo correct the archive, run the script in Bash on any GNU/Linux distro like follows:\r\n\r\n       perl correct.pl poor outf_poor.xml poor.corrected.xml\r\n\r\n       perl correct.pl rich outf_rich.xml rich.corrected.xml\r\nIt will make another file with corrected ampersands and added DOCTYPE and DTD definitons.\r\n\r\nThe scripts will probably work on OS X too, and maybe even Cygwin.\r\n<h3>Analyzing for fun</h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Frankly, I can't wait to see what will people do with this stuff. And I like graphs, so I made some :)</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Uploaded torrents</h4>\r\n<p>First, let's look at the most basic thing - how many torrents people upload a day? Is it growing or staying about the same? Let's put the days on X axis and number of torrents on Y axis.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/555rLCB\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/555rLCBl.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<p>Well, as we can see, the number is growing, even when it's not as smooth as it could be. We can see some drops to zero, I guess it's the days when Pirate Bay was off.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Let's look at the cumulative functions - how much is the number of torrents growing over time?</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/ncPwKgU\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/ncPwKgUl.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<p>It's growing nicely. But despite what Pirate Bay says in its footer, I found only about 2 millions of torrents.</p>\r\n<h4>Number of seeders</h4>\r\n<p>Now, let's look at something else - is it true, that the newest torrents are seeded the most, or not? Let's put all the torrents on X axis, sort them by time, and put the number of seeders on Y axis. Once R finally crunches the numbers, we get this graph.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/TskOXyu\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/TskOXyul.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<p>We can see that except for some insanely popular torrents in the past, the more recent torrents are indeed the more seeded ones. However, when I tried to look at the seeder numbers closely, I realized one thing.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Slightly more than one third of the torrents have no seeders at all. Nothing. </p>\r\n<p>Actually, more than 3/4 of the torrents have 4 seeders or less. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>On the other hands, couple of torrents are insanely popular. </p>\r\n\r\n<p>Of course, we can try to visualize this. If you try to graph the popularity on a linear scale and without cutting the very few outliers on the right, you get crazy graph like this. (On X is number of seeders, on Y number of torrents with that number of seeders.)</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/v7lZ6OS\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/v7lZ6OSl.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<p>Yeah, this is not going to work. Let's cut the outliers on the right (say, torrents with >2000 seeders) and let's put the y axis on logarithmic scale.</p>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://imgur.com/mvZG6TT\"><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/mvZG6TTl.png\" title=\"Hosted by imgur.com\" alt=\"\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<p>Keep in mind that Y axis is on logarithmical scale. This is pretty crazy.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>What's to take from this? Torrents on TPB are really, really unevenly seeded. Unfortunately, with no seeders, magnet links are useless. So, for about 1/3 of this archive, the magnet links are not really useful, and for 3/4, they are useful only if you are very lucky. OTOH, the torrents files would make this archive much more giant.</p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Words</h4>\r\n<p>Last but not the least, you can do fun stuff with the descriptions and comments themselves. Unluckily, I currently have no time to play with it, so I just looked at the names of the torrents, did some primitive tokenization and looked at the most favourite words in the torrent names. Well, the results speak for themselves :)</p>\r\n\r\n<table>\r\n    <tr><td><b>Order</b></td><td><b>Appearances</b></td><td><b>Word</b></td></tr>\r\n     <tr><td> 1 </td><td> 184015 </td><td>XviD</td></tr>\r\n <tr><td> 2 </td><td> 177920</td><td> The</td></tr>\r\n      <tr><td>3 </td><td> 137824</td><td> HDTV</td></tr>\r\n <tr><td> 4 </td><td> 86804 </td><td>x264</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td> 5 </td><td> 74855 </td><td>DVDRip</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 6 </td><td> 65450 </td><td>720p</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td> 7 </td><td> 48845 </td><td>XXX</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td> 8 </td><td> 39148 </td><td>2011</td></tr>\r\n <tr><td> 9 </td><td> 34117 </td><td>2012</td></tr>\r\n <tr><td> 10 </td><td> 32547 </td><td>2010</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td> 11 </td><td> 31453 </td><td>avi</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td> 12 </td><td> 28516 </td><td>PDTV</td></tr>\r\n <tr><td> 13 </td><td> 27057 </td><td>VA</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td> 14 </td><td> 24888 </td><td>2009</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td> 15 </td><td> 24527 </td><td>com</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 16 </td><td> 22558 </td><td>AC3</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 17 </td><td> 22072 </td><td>A</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 18 </td><td> 21019 </td><td>2</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td> 19 </td><td> 19167 </td><td>WS</td></tr>\r\n <tr><td> 20 </td><td> 18563 </td><td>2008</td></tr>\r\n <tr><td> 21 </td><td> 18065 </td><td>1</td></tr>\r\n <tr><td> 22 </td><td> 17836 </td><td>480p</td></tr>\r\n <tr><td> 23 </td><td> 16610 </td><td>SWESUB</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 24 </td><td> 16140 </td><td>12</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 25 </td><td> 16123 </td><td>of</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td> 26 </td><td> 14861 </td><td>the</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td> 27 </td><td> 14300 </td><td>Of</td></tr>\r\n  <tr><td> 28 </td><td> 13706 </td><td>Big</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 29 </td><td> 12662 </td><td>and</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 30 </td><td> 12592 </td><td>BluRay</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 31 </td><td> 12563 </td><td>DVDRiP</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 32 </td><td> 12421 </td><td>mSD</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 33 </td><td> 12233 </td><td>3</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 34 </td><td> 12019 </td><td>s</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 35 </td><td> 11701</td><td> XViD</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 36 </td><td> 11532 </td><td>2007</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 37 </td><td> 10978 </td><td>I</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 38 </td><td> 10898 </td><td>2HD</td></tr>\r\n   <tr><td> 39 </td><td> 10556 </td><td>LOL</td></tr>\r\n    <tr><td> 40 </td><td> 10504</td><td> 10</td></tr>\r\n\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n<p>Well there you have it.
