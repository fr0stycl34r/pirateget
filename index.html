<p>This is an up-to-date fork of Karel BÃ­lek's scripts at <a href="http://runn1ng.github.io/">http://runn1ng.github.io/</a></p>

<h1>Pirate Bay archival</h1>

<p>Some time ago, I did an experiment on how small I can make ThePirateBay while keeping the important information. People apparently liked it.</p>

<p>Well, now some months later, I wanted to do two things - first, make it even smaller and correct all the mistakes I did before. Second - I wanted to create another version that will have all the additional information - most importantly, all the comments and text information. For me, pirate bay is not just the torrents, but mainly the additional information - "How fake is the file; what can I expect to find inside?"</p>

<p>So I did both.</p>

<p>The "smaller" file is for download here - it has 76 MB 7zipped and it really has just names and magnet links.</p>

<p>The "bigger" file is for download here - in 631 MB 7zipped, it has all the information about number of seeders, leechers (at the time of the download), magnet links, descriptions, size, and perhaps most importantly - comments. It does not contain the "big" torrent files. But apart from that, you can really reconstruct the whole Pirate Bay from it. (I will touch this later though.)</p>

<p>Note: since the downloading itself took quite long, the data in the older torrents can be slightly out of date.
How I did it</p>
