          <h1>PB archive scripts </h1>

<p>This is an up-to-date fork of Karel BÃ­lek's scripts at <a href="http://runn1ng.github.io/">http://runn1ng.github.io/</a></p>

<h1>Pirate Bay archival</h1>

<p>Some time ago, I did an experiment on how small I can make ThePirateBay while keeping the important information. People apparently liked it.</p>

<p>Well, now some months later, I wanted to do two things - first, make it even smaller and correct all the mistakes I did before. Second - I wanted to create another version that will have all the additional information - most importantly, all the comments and text information. For me, pirate bay is not just the torrents, but mainly the additional information - "How fake is the file; what can I expect to find inside?"</p>

<p>So I did both.</p>

<p>The "smaller" file is for download <a href="https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8156416">here</a> - it has 76 MB 7zipped and it really has just names and magnet links.</p>

<p>The "bigger" file is for download <a href="https://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8163015">here</a> - in 631 MB 7zipped, it has all the information about number of seeders, leechers (at the time of the download), magnet links, descriptions, size, and perhaps most importantly - <b>comments</b>. It does <i>not</i> contain the "big" torrent files. But apart from that, you can really reconstruct the whole Pirate Bay from it. (I will touch this later though.)</p>

<p>Note: since the downloading itself took quite long, the data in the older torrents can be slightly out of date.</p>

<h1>How I did it</h1>

<p>With this script! Unlike previously, this time I decided to output XML so people parsing it won't get so crazy.</p>

<p>Some people noticed that the XML files are not well-formed and valid. I am sorry for that, but 
Karel made perl scripts that will fix them both, see <a href="https://github.com/fr0stycl34r/pirateget/blob/master/correct.pl">https://github.com/fr0stycl34r/pirateget/blob/master/correct.pl</a>. The script needs Perl, Bash and Sed, so you will need GNU/Linux (OS X may be sufficient but I have nowhere to try).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pirate Bay admins always started blocking my computers (I guess they thought I am a evil attacker or something), so I had to switch from computer to computer. And because I wanted to make sure I really didn't miss any torrent, the whole thing took about half a year.</p>

<p>Also, ThePirateBay had some downtimes during the download. I tried to "catch" them, but I still lost about 100-300 torrents. I am too lazy to sort them out now. Sorry.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can run this script with:</p>

<pre><code>   perl  piratebay.pl
</code></pre>

<p>To correct the archive, run the script in Bash on any GNU/Linux distro like follows:</p>

<pre><code>   perl correct.pl poor outf_poor.xml poor.corrected.xml

   perl correct.pl rich outf_rich.xml rich.corrected.xml
</code></pre>

<p>It will make another file with corrected ampersands and added DOCTYPE and DTD definitons.</p>

<p>The scripts will probably work on OS X too, and maybe even Cygwin.</p>

<h3>Analyzing for fun</h3>

<p>Frankly, I can't wait to see what will people do with this stuff. And I like graphs, so I made some :)</p>

<h4>Uploaded torrents</h4>

<p>First, let's look at the most basic thing - how many torrents people upload a day? Is it growing or staying about the same? Let's put the days on X axis and number of torrents on Y axis.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/555rLCB"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/555rLCBl.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Well, as we can see, the number is growing, even when it's not as smooth as it could be. We can see some drops to zero, I guess it's the days when Pirate Bay was off.</p>

<p>Let's look at the cumulative functions - how much is the number of torrents growing over time?</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/ncPwKgU"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ncPwKgUl.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" alt=""></a></p>

<p>It's growing nicely. But despite what Pirate Bay says in its footer, I found only about 2 millions of torrents.</p>

<h4>Number of seeders</h4>

<p>Now, let's look at something else - is it true, that the newest torrents are seeded the most, or not? Let's put all the torrents on X axis, sort them by time, and put the number of seeders on Y axis. Once R finally crunches the numbers, we get this graph.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/TskOXyu"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/TskOXyul.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" alt=""></a></p>

<p>We can see that except for some insanely popular torrents in the past, the more recent torrents are indeed the more seeded ones. However, when I tried to look at the seeder numbers closely, I realized one thing.</p>

<p>Slightly more than one third of the torrents have no seeders at all. Nothing. </p>

<p>Actually, more than 3/4 of the torrents have 4 seeders or less. </p>

<p>On the other hands, couple of torrents are insanely popular. </p>

<p>Of course, we can try to visualize this. If you try to graph the popularity on a linear scale and without cutting the very few outliers on the right, you get crazy graph like this. (On X is number of seeders, on Y number of torrents with that number of seeders.)</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/v7lZ6OS"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/v7lZ6OSl.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Yeah, this is not going to work. Let's cut the outliers on the right (say, torrents with &gt;2000 seeders) and let's put the y axis on logarithmic scale.</p>

<p><a href="http://imgur.com/mvZG6TT"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/mvZG6TTl.png" title="Hosted by imgur.com" alt=""></a></p>

<p>Keep in mind that Y axis is on logarithmical scale. This is pretty crazy.</p>

<p>What's to take from this? Torrents on TPB are really, really unevenly seeded. Unfortunately, with no seeders, magnet links are useless. So, for about 1/3 of this archive, the magnet links are not really useful, and for 3/4, they are useful only if you are very lucky. OTOH, the torrents files would make this archive much more giant.</p>

<h4>Words</h4>

<p>Last but not the least, you can do fun stuff with the descriptions and comments themselves. Unluckily, I currently have no time to play with it, so I just looked at the names of the torrents, did some primitive tokenization and looked at the most favourite words in the torrent names. Well, the results speak for themselves :)</p>

</table><p>Well there you have it. All I have been able to squeeze from the archive for now, but I think more people will have more ideas. The links are on the top.</p>
