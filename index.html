          <h1>PB archive scripts</h1>

<p>This is an up-to-date fork of Karel Bílek's scripts at <a href="http://runn1ng.github.io/">http://runn1ng.github.io/</a></p>

<h1>Pirate Bay archival</h1>

<p>Some time ago, I did an experiment on how small I can make ThePirateBay while keeping the important information. People apparently liked it.</p>

<p>Well, now some months later, I wanted to do two things - first, make it even smaller and correct all the mistakes I did before. Second - I wanted to create another version that will have all the additional information - most importantly, all the comments and text information. For me, pirate bay is not just the torrents, but mainly the additional information - "How fake is the file; what can I expect to find inside?"</p>

<p>So I did both.</p>

<p>The "smaller" file is for download <a href="http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8156416">here</a> - it has 76 MB 7zipped and it really has just names and magnet links.</p>

<p>The "bigger" file is for download <a href="http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8163015">here</a> - in 631 MB 7zipped, it has all the information about number of seeders, leechers (at the time of the download), magnet links, descriptions, size, and perhaps most importantly - <b>comments</b>. It does <i>not</i> contain the "big" torrent files. But apart from that, you can really reconstruct the whole Pirate Bay from it. (I will touch this later though.)</p>

<p>Note: since the downloading itself took quite long, the data in the older torrents can be slightly out of date.</p>

<h1>How I did it</h1>

<p>With this script! Unlike previously, this time I decided to output XML so people parsing it won't get so crazy.</p>

<p>Some people noticed that the XML files are not well-formed and valid. I am sorry for that, but Karel made perl scripts that will fix them both, see <a href="https://github.com/urras/pirateget/blob/master/correct.pl">https://github.com/urras/pirateget/blob/master/correct.pl</a>. The script needs Perl, Bash and Sed, so you will need GNU/Linux (OS X may be sufficient but I have nowhere to try).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Pirate Bay admins always started blocking my computers (I guess they thought I am a evil attacker or something), so I had to switch from computer to computer. And because I wanted to make sure I really didn't miss any torrent, the whole thing took about half a year.</p>

<p>Also, ThePirateBay had some downtimes during the download. I tried to "catch" them, but I still lost about 100-300 torrents. I am too lazy to sort them out now. Sorry.</p>

<p>Anyway, you can run this script with:</p>

<pre><code>perl piratebay.pl
</code></pre>

<p>To correct the archive, run the script in Bash on any GNU/Linux distro like follows:</p>

<pre><code>perl correct.pl poor outf_poor.xml outf_poor.corrected.xml

perl correct.pl rich outf_rich.xml outf_rich.corrected.xml
</code></pre>

<p>It will make another file with corrected ampersands and added DOCTYPE and DTD definitons.</p>

<p>The scripts will probably work on OS X too, and maybe even Cygwin.</p>

<p>These scripts were made by Karel Bílek. If you want to contact him, send him an email <a href="mailto:atkb@karelbilek.com">atkb@karelbilek.com</a> . Also, please send him bitcoins to 1CrwjoKxvdbAnPcGzYjpvZ4no4S71neKXT if you want.</p>
